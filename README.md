# COSC 3360: HW 3

# Description: 
This c++ code simulates page replacement algorithms used for virtual memory management. Reading one input file containg memory sets for algothims as IFO, MRU, LRU-X, LRU, LFU, OPT, and Working Set and outputs the total page replacements that occur in each.

The program takes input parameterrs such as total page frams, page size, number of pag frames per process, window size(used in certain algothims), minimum and maximum free pool sizes, and the total number of processes.

# How to run
  1. Complie the code my entering inside the terminal: 'g++ -o test main.cpp -pthread'
  2. Execting the compiled program in the terminal with the input files. Ex: 'Assignment3_Input./test .txt'
